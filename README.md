## My Learnings

- As I didn't followed any tutorial (I was trapped in _tutorial hell_ for a long), initially it felt like impossible, but gradually I made it.
- It was first time I am using **Tailwind CSS**. It was a wonderful start. Things felt very easy to grasp. It was really easy to create responsive layouts with it.
- I used Javascript FetchAPI to fetch data (I were using axios always). I felt it's enough for small scale needs.
- It took me a long time to implement background changing feature, it taught me many things. Finally I figured out that it was so easy.
- It was first time I am facing so many bugs, so it was a wonderful experience to debug issues.
- I managed to implement a comic style look and feel (I don't know how much good it is).
- The total working was similiar to one of my previous projects, [Addviser](https://github.com/wajid-nv/addviser). So it was easy to implement at some points.
- I also tried to improve readability and coding standards as I can.
